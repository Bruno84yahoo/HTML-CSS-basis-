                            <p>Crows are considered intelligent animals. It is said that the raven with wolves can form
                                a pact. If a crow saw a wounded animal, it would look for a wolf and attract his
                                attention. After the wolf is done with the prey, the crow will continue to eat it.
                                Ravens are also known to use "tools"; with chopsticks they pick up the food from the
                                cavities and with stones they break the nuts. The crow can mimic the sounds of its
                                environment, such as the human voice. </p>
                            <p>The raven is significantly larger than the black raven and the tower. The length of the
                                head-tail is 65 centimeters, the wingspan of 1.20 meters and the average weight is 1250
                                grams. The beak is relatively heavier and slightly curved. In flight, the bird can be
                                recognized by the relatively larger head profile and wider, flared, diamond-shaped tail.
                                It also flies higher than the aforementioned species and with a slower wing flap, it
                                floats regularly for a while, while an air line flies more intentionally somewhere. The
                                noise is lower than with crows.</p>
